  abstract={Spectrum sensing is one of the major annexes in modern communication systems. It is the basis of a cognitive radio system. Implementation of an efficient spectrum sensing machine involves many challenges, such as processing delay, false alarms, misdetection, detection of weak signals in a noisy environment. The present work reports a physical experimental setup on spectrum sensing. Energy detection-based spectrum sensing machine is implemented with a software-defined radio and an open-source software toolkit GNU Radio. The design of the device is thoroughly deliberated. The result proves the proficiency of the device. The scope of this work is to implement the backbone of a spectrum sensing test bench that can be further utilized for executing and testing new emerging studies.},
