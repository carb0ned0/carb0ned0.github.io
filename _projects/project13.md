## Overview/Problem Statement

Smart homes offer convenience, but traditional systems lack intelligence, leading to inefficient energy use and manual overrides. Integrating AI can predict user needs and automate dynamically.

This project developed an AI-enhanced smart home system controlling lights, thermostats, and security via predictive models. As the sole developer, I designed the architecture, integrated hardware, and implemented ML algorithms.

## Process/Research

Focused on AI for IoT.

1. **Hardware Selection:** Chose compatible devices.
    * **Research:** IoT protocols like Zigbee, Wi-Fi.
    * **Decision:** Raspberry Pi as hub, ESP32 sensors.

2. **AI Modeling:** Predict user behavior.
    * **Research:** Time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning.
    * **Decision:** LSTM for predictions, RL for optimization.

3. **Integration:** Seamless control.
    * **Research:** APIs for devices.

## Solution/Implementation

System uses Raspberry Pi to collect data, run models, and control devices.

* **Data Pipeline:** MQTT for communication.
* **ML Models:** Trained on user data for automation.
* **UI:** Web app for monitoring.

## Status

This project is currently in progress and nearing completion. I will update this page with results, reflections, and code as I finalize the work and gain new insights to improve myself.

> Code and design files is yet to be uploaded.
