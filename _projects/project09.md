## Overview/Problem Statement

Medical image analysis needs reliable pipelines for deployment.

This project builds an MLOps setup for MedMNIST classification. As the sole developer, I integrated training, deployment, and monitoring.

## Process/Research

MLOps for ML.

1. **Datasets:** MedMNIST's 18 sets.
    * **Research:** 2D/3D images, tasks.

2. **Model:** CNNs for classification.
    * **Research:** PyTorch baselines.

3. **Pipeline:** CI/CD, containerization.
    * **Research:** Docker, GitHub Actions.

## Status

This project is currently in progress and nearing completion. I will update this page with results, reflections, and code as I finalize the work and gain new insights to improve myself.

> Code and design files is yet to be uploaded.
