## Overview/Problem Statement

Custom hardware enables tailored IoT solutions, but design complexity is a barrier.

Based on the tutorial, this project creates an ESP32-S3 board with USB-C. As the sole developer, I handled schematic, layout, and assembly.

## Process/Research

Embedded design best practices.

1. **Components:** ESP32, FTDI, LDO.
    * **Research:** Datasheets, footprints.

2. **Schematic:** Power, USB, GPIO.
    * **Research:** Differential routing.

3. **PCB Layout:** 4-layer, impedance control.
    * **Research:** DRC rules.

## Solution/Implementation

Altium-designed PCB.

* **Schematic:** Net naming, annotations.
* **Layout:** Placement, routing, polygons.
* **Fabrication:** JLCPCB, Gerbers.

## Status

This project is currently in progress and nearing completion. I will update this page with results, reflections, and code as I finalize the work and gain new insights to improve myself.

> Code and design files is yet to be uploaded.
