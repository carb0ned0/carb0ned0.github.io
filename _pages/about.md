Happiness doesn’t peak when you get what you want—**it peaks** in the moments just before, when you’re on the edge of discovery. That anticipation, that restless pursuit, is what drives me. *Anticipation eclipses arrival; the hunt outshines the trophy.*

What pulls me in is the thrill of tinkering, understanding the layers of how the world ticks. That’s **research**. And when I add something to it? Then it's **development**.  

The "*almost there*" that keeps me up until 4 a.m.—stare-down battles with stubborn circuit boards, chasing that single green LED glow. Or the quiet roar when an algorithm crushes `963 out of 963 Test cases Passed`. Or those "aha!" moments when the model strikes its sweet spot, threading the needle between *empirical risk* (nailing the training data) and *generalization error* (thriving on the unknown).

I **~~work~~** **live** to understand how things function beneath the surface, guided by first-principles thinking approach. In unraveling complexity, I find purpose—and maybe, just maybe if I could add something valuable, then I'd leave the world a little sharper, a little more connected.

If that's the kind of mind you're hunting for, let's talk. I'd love to dive in and build with you.
