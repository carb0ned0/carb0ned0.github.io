# my portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built on a heavily customized version of the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme. I've made numerous tweaks to suit my needs, e.g., custom layouts, additional sections, styling changes, etc. The site is designed to showcase my work, projects, publications, and more in a clean, responsive format.

The live site is hosted at [github](https://carb0n3d0.github.io) (e.g., via GitHub Pages).
